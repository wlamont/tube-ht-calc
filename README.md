#Convective Heat Transfer Coefficient

This is a lightweight gui that calculates the convective heat transfer coefficient for internal flows within tubes.  The code uses four popular correlations: Petukhov, Gnielinski, Dittus-Boetler, and Sieder and Tate.

Run circTubes0022.py from python to launch GUI.  Select your desired correlation and select 'Ok', the window that pops-up will require input (in blue) and will calculate the output (in red).  For more information on the correlations click the 'About' button on the pop-up screen
